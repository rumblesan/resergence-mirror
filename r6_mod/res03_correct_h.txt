Subject:  Ring-Mod Schematic error

Hello Ken, (and all)
I just took a peak at the 1973 Ring Mod Schematic in 
the Files section and noticed an error. The 33K resistor attached to 
pin 3 of the LM307 shouldn't go to ground but rather to the junction 
between the right side of the X input Capacitor (100n) and the 
ajoining 68K resistor.
As it's connected right now you merely have a VCA circuit.

Just thought I should bring it up in case anyone tried building the 
thing and found it didn't "Ring".

That's all for now.....

Dean.

Actually I don't think the 33K should be there at all. There should be 
a link between pin 3 and the 100n/68K junction. The 33K should be present 
in the VCA but is deleted in the RM.

Yeah, the schemo is drawn incorrectly, but Ken got the PCB correct.

That will teach me to adapt one piece of artwork to another. 
The corrected version has been uploaded.
