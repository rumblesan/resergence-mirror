So obvious I never even looked! In fact, I use 220R here, for two reasons 
- the earlier Serges use 220R rather than 330R, and more significantly, I have
thousands of 220R here.

Rather like installing 1M where you need 15R and vice versa. I've done that
before (why can't I hear an output from that speaker? 1M in series instead
of 15R)
