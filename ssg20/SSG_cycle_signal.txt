Subject:Ê Re: [SergeModular] Smooth Stepped Cycle Jacks?

It does exactly the same thing. 
CYCLE is +10v when high, and -10v when low. When the output goes 
above about 4v, CYCLE goes low, and when the output goes below 
about -1v, it goes high. (Those numbers seem odd - I wonder if 
I have some strange power issues? I don't remember noticing 
that before...) 

To get the stepped section to oscillate this way, though, you 
also have to supply a stream of pulses to SAMPLE. A month or so 
ago I spent some time really grokking the SSG. I think I was able 
to completely satisfy myself on every point about its behavior, 
even answering some unresolved questions from SMOG. 

The module really does make sense; all of its apparent strangeness 
can be explained. One interesting thing is that the stepped section 
is just like the smooth section, except that (1) the slew rate range 
(knob + cv) is much higher than the smooth section, and (2) SAMPLE 
rising edges are turned into short, fixed-length pulses, which when 
inverted become the effective HOLD input. I.e., it doesn't actually 
step; it just slews very quickly for some short, fixed period when 
you pulse SAMPLE.

Thanks.
