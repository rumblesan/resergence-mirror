I reverse-engineered that schematic, and I'm 99% certain that's how
it is.  Whether Serge or Rex meant it to be that way is another matter. 
Pin 2 isn't a virtual earth, so it should still work - I assume it must
work, otherwise there would be some unhappy SSG users.  There was also 
a resistor soldered on the back of the same board, where
they'd either missed one out or decided to add one later, so they're not
infallible.  

The board was dated '99.
