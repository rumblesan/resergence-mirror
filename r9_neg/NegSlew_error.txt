Subject:  Negative Slew error.  

One of our good brothers had pointed out an error on the Negative Slew 
resergence board RES09. 

On the bottom LED (near the power supply connector), the LC pad goes to +6V 
instead of to 0V like it should. 

You'll need to cut a track and jumper it to 0V (and it's associated 100n cap, 
which is also connected to the wrong spot).
