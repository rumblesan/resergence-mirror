Serge MIX board
===============

This 1.5" wide second generation board is a 
multipurpose dual/quad amp/mixer, and was used
in a wide variety of modules until replaced by
the 203 MIX and the 2xx (?) AMX boards.

The board is designed so it can be cut in half
if only part of one is needed.  When used as a 
full board, the 0v and -12v are linked by tracks 
but the +12v has to be linked across by joining 
the X pads on each half.  I guess this is to 
allow one half to be run off +6v if necessary.

Parts can be omitted or linked out as necessary
to produce four AC or DC coupled inverting mixers
or inverting amps, or sections cab be linked (by
R9) to produce two non-inverting mixers.


I've seen this board configured as:

- Dual Audio Mixer
- Send & Receive
- Stereo Mixer Panner
- Preamp
- Scaling Buffer

and probably as other processors and mixers.
