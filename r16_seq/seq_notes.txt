On the Programmer modules.  
A typical early system would have a sequencer and two four-stage programmers.

That would work, or feed the outputs of the sequencer into the Processor module.
Of course, neither the Programmer or the Dual Processor would give you ten 
different voltages in a sequence, but if there are diodes on the sequencer outputs
(later version pcb?) you can connect two or more sequencer outputs to one stage input.

That means you could have a ten note sequence so long as you only had four (or
whatever) _different_ notes.  For example, plug outputs 1 and 5 to programmer 
stage 1, outputs 2,4,6 & 8 to stage 2, output 3 to stage 3 and output 7 to 
stage 4 to produce a useful 8 note sequence.  

Does that make sense?

There are a few limitations with all 4017 based sequencers, like they reset to 
the first note so you step to the second note of a sequence on the first clock.
If you're thinking of building something sophisticated, the 4017 might not be 
your best option.  If you want simple, it's there. The good things about the 
4017 in the Serge is it's simple and can be used for a variety of roles, 
like a sub-octave divider. 

Just my 6p worth...
